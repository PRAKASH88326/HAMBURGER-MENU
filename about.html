    <h2>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat,
         typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, 
         lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, 
         relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently
         placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.
         Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and other restaurants. 
         There are many international and regional variations of hamburger. 
         Some of the largest multinational fast-food chains have a burger as one of their core 
         products: McDonald's Big Mac and Burger King's Whopper have become global icons of American culture.
